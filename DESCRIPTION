Description: A bridging R package to facilitate gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) in the context of single-cell RNA sequencing. Using raw count information, Seurat objects, or SingleCellExperiment format, users can perform and visualize ssGSEA, GSVA, AUCell, and UCell-based enrichment calculations across individual cells. Alternatively, escape supports use of rank-based GSEA, such as the use of differential gene expression via fgsea.
